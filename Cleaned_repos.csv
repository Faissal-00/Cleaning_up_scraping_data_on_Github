The seamless docking of orders for repairs eliminates the complicated process of receiving and dispatching orders from the original property customer service. Fang can receive orders and assign internal work on the management background, which greatly shortens the intermediate link of serving building residential area owners and improves the response speed and timeliness of door-to-door service.
